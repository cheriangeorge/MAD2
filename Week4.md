### Week 4 Notes

#### Vue
* Declarative Rendering - Phrase popularised by vue
  - Reactivity 
  - Directives
  - Event handling
  - Class and Style binding
  - Lists and Loops

* Reactivity 
  - Auto update in response to changes in data
  - Binding between model (data) and view (display)
  - Focus on What instead of How in declerative programming - key to understanding philosophy behind vue.
* Why ?
  - User interaction is fundamentally reactive
    - Respond to changes in input
  - Change in one parameter may need multiple updates on screen
    - User logs in
    - Update navigation : add logged in links
    - Update displayed list of courses
    - Change colours based on theme
